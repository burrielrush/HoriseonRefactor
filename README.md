## This is a homework project to test my understanding of how to refactor an already existing code to make it have alt attributes, how to ensure that all heading attributes are in sequential order, finding descriptive titles, find semantic html elements, ensure all elements have logical stucture and provide a ledgible and thorough READ.ME file.
  
  -I am motivated to learn these new concepts so that I can further my knowledge and successfully become a full stack web engineer. 
  -I took on this project in order to learn how to understand heading attributes and making sure they are in sequential order, finding descriptive titles, finding semantic html elements, ensurubg all elements have logical stucture and provide a ledgible and thorough READ.ME file. I am applying the knowledge learned in course prework and in the activities to this first homework project.
  -Although the project was mostly to understand what the pre given code entailed and to verify that I have a basic understanding of the code and what it is doing, I added accessible alt altributes to the code so that the photos that are present on the webpage are readable to a webpage user that may be blind. I explained the content of the photo to the best of my extent. 
  -I learned the basic syntax of HTML and CSS. I leaned how to add and change elements of the webpage. I learned how to use flex boxes. 

  Major change made to base code: adding alt attributes to photos.
  
  
  Overall this was a good first project. I'm excited to learn and further enjoy this class we press into the depths of web developement.
